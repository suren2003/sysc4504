Lab 2: Working with CSS

==================================================
LAB ASSIGNMENT
==================================================

This project requires some CSS styling. The focus here is on working with box properties.

You can download a ZIP file from Brightspace that contains three files:
- an image (checkmark.svg)
- an HTML document (lab02.html)
- a style sheet (lab02.css)

You need to modify lab02.css only, following the step-by-step instructions below.

==================================================
INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================

1. Examine lab02.html in a browser and then in the editor of your choice.
   Do not make any changes to this file.

2. Edit the file lab02.css by defining styles so that it looks similar to that
   shown in the figure on the next page. The steps below provide more details.

3. Add about 40px padding to the <body>.
   Set the width of the <section> to 910px.
   You will need a variety of different text styling, using a variety of
   different font sizes and font weights, as shown in the figure.

4. Each of the column <div> elements must have its display property set to
   inline-block. This will allow the <div> elements to sit together on the
   same line.

   Later in the course, covering Chapter 7 in the textbook, you will learn
   other techniques for achieving this effect.

   Also set some of the other column properties to the values shown in the
   figure. The second column will have a different background color.

   Remove the list bullets by setting the list-style-type to none.

5. For the list items within each column, make every second item a different
   color using the nth-child pseudo selector.

   Use the rgba() function, which will darken the underlying background color.

6. Specify the link, visited, and hover formatting of the Sign Up link.
   Notice the rounded corners and the box shadow.

7. For the bottom “confidence” <div>, the list items have a background image
   (checkmark.svg).

   Set the background-size property to 24px.

   The padding-left and the margin of each <li> item will have to be modified
   so they don’t overlap the checkmark image.

   Remove the bullet from each list item.

CSS can be overwhelming at times. The instructions above break the task down
into smaller steps. Test each step along the way in a browser.

It’s not important that your page matches exactly the image shown in the
figure below, but try to get it pretty similar.

SUBMISSION
